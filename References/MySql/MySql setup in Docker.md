    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ 

Get the random password generated for the root user
===================================================
Once initialization is finished, the command's output is going to contain the random password generated for the root user. 
Check the password with, for example, with following: 

Command: docker logs container_name 2>&1 | grep GENERATED

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker logs mysql 2>&1 | grep GENERATED
    [Entrypoint] GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD: nIDgErGON9yfgAcuRYwH3fR@gq

Connecting to MySQL Server from within the Container
====================================================
Once the server is ready, you can run the mysql client within the MySQL Server container you just started, and connect it to the MySQL Server. 
Use the "docker exec -it" command to start a mysql client inside the Docker container you have started, like the following:

Command: docker exec -it container_name mysql -uroot -p

When asked, enter the GENERATED ROOT PASSWORD (From the above section). 
Because the MYSQL_ONETIME_PASSWORD option is true by default, after you have connected a mysql client to the server, 
you must reset the server root password by issuing this statement:

    mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

Substitute password with the password of your choice. Once the password is reset, the server is ready for use.

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker exec -it mysql mysql -uroot -p
    Enter password: 
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

    mysql> exit
    Bye
    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ 

    (Note: I have here for simplicity reset password as string password only)

Container Shell Access
======================
To have shell access to your MySQL Server container, use the docker exec -it command to start a bash shell inside the container:

Command: docker exec -it container_name bash 

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker exec -it mysql bash
    bash-4.2# ls /var/lib/mysql
    #innodb_temp   binlog.000002  ca.pem	       ib_buffer_pool  ibdata1	mysql.ibd	 performance_schema  server-cert.pem  undo_001
    auto.cnf       binlog.index   client-cert.pem  ib_logfile0     ibtmp1	mysql.sock	 private_key.pem     server-key.pem   undo_002
    binlog.000001  ca-key.pem     client-key.pem   ib_logfile1     mysql	mysql.sock.lock  public_key.pem      sys
    bash-4.2# exit
    exit


Stopping and Deleting a MySQL Container
=======================================
To stop the MySQL Server container we have created, use this 

Command: docker stop container_name

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker stop mysql
    mysql

To start the MySQL Server container again:
==========================================
docker start mysql

To stop and start again the MySQL Server container with a single command:
========================================================================
docker restart mysql

To delete the MySQL container, stop it first, and then use the docker rm command:
=================================================================================
docker stop mysql
docker rm mysql


# Connecting with Mysql Workbench
=================================
=================================

Download and install same version of Workbench from MySql Oracle website, as same/compatible to mysql version you are running.

Then, we need to run the mysql image exposing ports. 

Also we cant connect as root user outside docker container. 

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker run --name mysql -p 3406:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql/mysql-server:latest
    e8249e5afbdcb938853d3bb641ae0ee1095469495888a4fd34275c96543ebb18

There, is trick. To set root user password, Set the environment variable MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to a password you want (As above).

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                               NAMES
    e8249e5afbdc        mysql/mysql-server:latest   "/entrypoint.sh mysqâ€¦"   39 seconds ago      Up 38 seconds (healthy)   33060/tcp, 0.0.0.0:3406->3306/tcp   mysql

Login to container, then login to mysql with user root; and password. Create a new user, which can be accessed from outside container.

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker exec -it mysql bash
    bash-4.2# mysql -uroot -p
    Enter password:

    mysql>

I create a user named "dev", grant all privileges, and quit.

Important:
=========
This step is required to log into MySQL from outside the container. The root user will not be able to log in from the host OS (Linux). Use % instead of localhost in dev@localhost.


    mysql> CREATE USER 'dev'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'dev'@'%';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> exit
    Bye

Test your connection of new user "dev"

    bash-4.2# mysql -udev -ppassword
