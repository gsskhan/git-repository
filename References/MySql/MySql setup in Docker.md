Starting a MySQL Server Instance
================================
Command: docker run --name=container_name -p <outside port>:<inside container port> -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<mysql root user password> -d image_name:tag

The -d option used in the docker run command above makes the container run in the background.

We need to run the mysql image exposing ports. Refer below, 3406 port is exposed for classic connections. And 33406 has been exposed for MySql X connections.

Also we cant connect as root user outside docker container by default. However, there are few tricks. 

First, make sure to set root user password in docker run command. To do this, set the environment variable MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to a password you want (As below). It will make mysql server on startup to set root user password provided by yourself.

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker run --name mysql -p 3406:3306 -p 33406:33060 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql/mysql-server:latest

Stopping and Restarting MySQL Database
========================================

User docker start/stop to start MySQL server container.

    Here our container name is: mysql. Hence execute following:-

    $ docker stop mysql
    $ docker ps
    $ docker start mysql
    $ docker ps

Connect to MySQL database
=========================

From inside container
---------------------

Use user as root and password as that value which we set to MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD in docker run command.

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker exec -it mysql bash
    bash-4.4# 
    bash-4.4# mysql -u root -p

    Enter password:

From outside container. Eg; SQL workbench, DB visualizer, etc
-------------------------------------------------------------

The root user will not be able to log in from the host OS (Linux) by default. These steps are required to login into MySQL from outside the container. 

Login to container, next then login to mysql with user root; and password. Then, Create a new user, which can be accessed from outside container. Remember to use % in hostname.

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker exec -it mysql bash
    bash-4.4# 
    bash-4.4# mysql -u root -p

Above, I created a user named "dev", granted all privileges, and quit. Note, also that I used % instead of localhost in dev@localhost. Else "dev" user would not be accessible outside from container.

Test your connection of new user "dev"

    gsskhan@gsskhan-Inspiron-3542:~$ docker exec -it mysql bash
    bash-4.4# 
    bash-4.4# mysql -udev -ppassword

Open Workbench and use below as connection details

    hostname: localhost
    port: 3406
    username: dev
    password: password

IMPORTANT! To enable external access to the database, you need to change localhost to % for any user.
=====================================================================================================
For root user: You can do via Workbench - by logging as user "dev", since you granted all previledges to it.

    In workbench, navigate to "Administration" > "Users And Priveledges" > Change "Limits to host matching" for root; user to % from localhost.

Alternatively, From docker container (Not verified -- Approach)
